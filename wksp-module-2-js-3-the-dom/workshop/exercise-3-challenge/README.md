# The DOM Workshop

## Exercise 3 - Counting down!

_This exercise is optional._

### The Task

Create a page that

1. contains 2 pages
    - homepage (`index.html`) that displays the current time and a link to the other page.
    - stopwatch page (`/stopwatch.html`) that starts a timer as soon as the page loads.

If you have some time ðŸ˜‰, and the inclination, you can make it look "decent." Go as crazy as you like. It doesn't need to be complicated, just a little "purty."
