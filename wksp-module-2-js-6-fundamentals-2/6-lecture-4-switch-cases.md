# 2.6.4 - JS More Fundamentals - Switch Cases

---

## The [Switch statement](https://love2dev.com/blog/javascript-switch-statement/)

is used as an alternate to multiple if / else statements.

---

Switch statements are a more efficient way to code when testing _multiple_ conditions.

---

### Characteristics

- The switch expression is evaluated once.
- The value of the expression is compared with the value of each case in order.
- If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.

///put most common outcome first; best practice
- A default case can be defined when the expression does not match a case.

---

### Example

```js
switch (time) {
    case 6:
        console.log('Wake up!');
        alarm();
        break; //means stop looking at cases now, return used instead only in exceptional cases
    case 22:
        console.log('off to bed');
        turnOffComputer();
        break;
    default:
        console.log('Keep doing what you\'re doing');
        noChange();
        break;
}
```

---

### `break` vs `return`

- `break` will _break_ out of the switch case.
- Without a `break`, the following cases will also be evaluated (regardless of following case values).
- `return` will stop the rest of the function from being evaluated.
