# Exercises 2

## 2.1 

Take a look at `data/books.js`. There is a list of books in there. Using this list, add the following functionality to the server:

- There is a page where I can view ALL of the books.
- I am able to provide the id of a book to view its details (web page)
    - This page should include all of the information on the book
    - be presented in a legible way (include the cover as well)
- I am able to get a list of books by their type.
    - Provide the title, author and smaller version cover
    - It should look more like a list.
    - No need to add the description.

**Don't forget to import the books array into `server.js`. Look at how top50 was _required_.
