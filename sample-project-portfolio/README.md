# Project Portfolio Template

It's high time you started to show off all of the stuff you've been doing!

## Setup

### File Structure

#### Homepage

- the `index.html` at the root of the project is your home page. Ths is where you will put links to all of the project folders.
- There are 3 placeholder projects already setup in the HTML. 
- When you want to add more, just copy paste the `<li>` and replace your content.
    - Title
    - Description
    - link to github folder, inside of repo
    - link (btn) to the project to see it in action.
- Create a folder for each of the projets. _Whatever you name it will be the url that links to it._
- Inside of that folder, add your `html`, `css`, and `js`. You can simply copy/paste the files from the workshop. Make sure that the HTML file is named `index` as well. It will prevent you from having to create an even longer url.

### [Surge](https://surge.sh/)

Install `surge`

- Open a terminal / PowerShell and type `npm install surge -g`
- Close the terminal / PowerShell and reopen it.
- To upload your site, you run `surge` from the root of your site folder.

You will be prompted in the terminal to enter email / password. It will also give you a random .surgesh domain. You can customize the beginning to better suit your needs.
